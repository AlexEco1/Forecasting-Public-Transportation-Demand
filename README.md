# Forecasting-Public-Transportation-Demand
A public transportation company is expecting an increase in demand for its services and is planning to acquire new buses and to extend its terminals. These investments require a reliable forecast of future demand. To create such forecasts, one can use data on historic demand. The companyâ€™s data warehouse has data on each 15-minute interval between 6:30 and 22:00, on the number of passengers arriving at the terminal. As a forecasting consultant, you have been asked to cre- ate a forecasting method that can generate forecasts for the number of passengers arriving at the terminal.
